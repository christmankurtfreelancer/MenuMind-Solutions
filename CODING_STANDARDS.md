- No space between function name and parentheses (e.g., `myFunction()`).
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections within a file.

## Comments

- Write descriptive comments for complex logic or unclear code sections.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.

## Functions and Methods

- Use clear and descriptive function/method names.
- Avoid unnecessary side effects in functions.

## Error Handling

- Properly handle errors and exceptions.
- Provide informative error messages for debugging.

## Documentation

- Document public APIs and functions.
- Update documentation when making significant changes.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for critical functionality.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
